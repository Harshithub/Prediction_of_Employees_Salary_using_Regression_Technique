# Prediction_of_Employees_Salary_using_Regression_Technique

Abstract:

Data of a company is very important for them. As analysis of data is very important for
the growth of company. It is because company needs to follow the trend of market to be
in market and grow. In a company or industry , managing their employees is one of the
difficult and most important criteria ,in accordance to make more profit to the company
with less use of resources. So, it became very necessary for any company to keep view
of , how much they are paying and to whom and on the basis of current demand , it is
required to analyze on the basis of previous salaries of employees ,that how much extra
employee of different payee scales , are needed to meet the requirement of company .
Company doesnot require these analysis only for hiring and firing the staff according to
requirements but they also have to give promotions to their employees on the basis of
their performance and abilities and also to manage all these such tasks . So there is a
need of some techniques , methods , model etc to do analysis and may be that is the
reason why companies spend huge amount in finding such type of techniques .


PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION:
Techniques , models for doing analysis on the dataset of a company are being improved
from many years. Analysis is not new for this century, it is being done from thousand’ s
of years back. Athough, nowadays we are very advanced in doing this comparatively,
But the hope of improvement is always there. Many companies are using different
softwares,techniques, model , AI , etc to do different type of analysis . But we always
try to improve the accuracy of models . So we need consistent improvement in accuracy
of data models.

In accordance to grow in the market, companies do lots of analysis on the salary of their
employees, for which they are always in search of such models which provide them
better accuracy . So that they can easily manage their expenditure on their employees
and the situation of growth of company as well. Forexample, if a company needs 100
software engineer for their new projects , then how they will decide that what range of
payee scale ,they should offer the engineers so that company don’t go in loss in worst
condition and they can make profit . For this , they have to analyze their previous
pattern of salary of employees and their growth and after analyzing they have to make
decision which must be profitable for them. That is the reason why they always try to
implement model which is more accurate .

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
So , here we are trying to make a model which can predict salary using machine
learning and we are trying to improve the accuracy . Our model can work on different
attributes for better prediction and we are using regression for the analyzation of data
sets .

Regression analysis is a statistical method to model the relationship between a
dependent (target) and independent (predictor) variables with one or more independent
variables.
More specifically, Regression analysis helps us to understand how the value of the dependent
variable is changing corresponding to an independent variable when other independent
variables are held fixed.
Regression is a supervised learning technique which helps in finding the correlation
between variables and enables us to predict the continuous output variable based on
the one or more predictor variables. It is mainly used for prediction, forecasting, time
series modeling, and determining the causal-effect relationship between
variables.

Algorithm

Step 1: Import the dataset 
Step 2: Read the dataset 
Step 3: Calculate the total missing in each column of dataset 
Step 4: Perform Data cleaning 
Step 5: Imputing Missing Values 
Step 6: Data understanding through visualization (Compare every column with sales to observe which
aspect is affecting sale of item) 
Step 7: Apply different regression technique and observe the result.

There are various types of regressions which are used in data science and machine
learning. Each type has its own importance on different scenarios, but at the core, all
the regression methods analyze the effect of the independent variable on dependent
variables. Here we are discussing some important types of regression which are given
below:

o Linear Regression
o Logistic Regression
o Polynomial Regression
o Support Vector Regression
o Decision Tree Regression
o Random Forest Regression
o Ridge Regression
o Lasso Regression:
